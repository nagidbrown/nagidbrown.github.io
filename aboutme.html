            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <h3>Professional</h3>
            <p>I have spent most of my summers doing research or internships at various institutions.  During the summer of 2009 I worked at an ethanol refinery called Geonet in the US Virgin Islands as dehydration technician.  The next summer (2010) I did research in the Weapons Material Research Division (WMRD) at an army base in Maryland.  In the summer of 2011 I did research at University of South Florida under a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program. gotcha
            </p>
            <p>After coming to UF in the Fall of 2011 I joined a research lab in my department the following semester and have been there since.  Within this lab I have worked on several different projects, some of which just fell to the waist side as a lot of research projects often do.  I have published a paper within that lab titled <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3770980/">A Highly Compliant Serpentine Shaped Polyimide Interconnect for Front-End Strain Relief in Chronic Neural Implants</a>.  
            </p>
            <p>In the lab I operate as a lab technician primarily: meaning that I operate machinery in the lab.  The main machine that I operate is called a nanoindenter.  What the nanoindenter does is use a tip, usually made of diamond, with known properties and indents on a sample with unknown properties.  While the indent is occuring data is being collected tracking the deformation of the material as the tip presses down on it.  This information is used to derive the machanical properties of the unknown material such as the young's modulus and hardness of the material.

            <h3>Casual</h3>
            <p>I am currently a junior at the University of Florida studying Mechanincal Engineering.  I enjoy playing sports such as basketball, volleyball, tennis, football, and ultimate frisbee.  
            </p>
            <p>I am a part of Theatre Strike Force, the premiere improv comedy and sketch troupe at the University of Florida.  I have been a part of the troupe since fall 2011 and find doing improv the most exciting and fun experience one can have.
