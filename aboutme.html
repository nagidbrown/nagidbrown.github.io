            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <h3>Professional</h3>
            <p>I have spent most of my summers doing research or internships at various institutions.  During the summer of 2009 I worked at an ethanol refinery called Geonet in the US Virgin Islands as dehydration technician.  The next summer (2010) I did research in the Weapons Material Research Division (WMRD) at an army base in Maryland.  In the summer of 2011 I did research at University of South Florida under a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program. gotcha
            </p>
            <p>After coming to UF in the Fall of 2011 I joined a research lab in my department the following semester and have been there since.  I have published a paper within that lab titled <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3770980/">A Highly Compliant Serpentine Shaped Polyimide Interconnect for Front-End Strain Relief in Chronic Neural Implants</a>.
            
            </p>
            
            <h3>Casual</h3>
            <p>I am currently a junior at the University of Florida studying Mechanincal Engineering.  I enjoy playing sports such as basketball, volleyball, tennis, football, and ultimate frisbee.  
            </p>
            <p>I am a part of Theatre Strike Force, the premiere improv comedy and sketch troupe at the University of Florida.  I have been a part of the troupe since fall 2011 and find doing improv the most exciting and fun experience one can have.
