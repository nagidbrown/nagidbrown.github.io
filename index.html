            <h3>Reason</h3>
            <p>This page is designed with the hopes that it increases my online presence in the world. More and more the world around us changing.  Before, the world would only recognize you if you were a TV or movie star or director, or published books.  But now anyone can become famous simply with an online presence. That presence can be through blogs, video creations or simply critics on anything under the sun. Now this page isn't here for the purpose of making me famous, but simply to get my name out there into the world in the hopes that one day someone will ask "Do you know this guy Nagid? He's got a web page all about him, he's pretty cool."</p>

            <h3>Me</h3>
            <p>I am a mechanical engineering student at the University of Florida. I love tinkering with things, figuring out how they work, taking them apart and reassembling them.  I also love making people smile and laugh which is a big reason that I do improv comedy.  I normally don't spend a ton of time on the internet, but I am now seeing the significance in doing it. In doing this web page I have since realized how poorly I am prepared for a professional setting and hope that this page will propel me further in readiness for the future that awaits me.
